# About me

Hi, my name is Piotr. Professionally I'm an Android developer at [Bikemap](https://www.bikemap.net){:target="_blank"} where with the team we are creating a great navigation app for all avid cyclists.

Besides working I'm a keen cyclist, runner and a book reader (not necessarily in that order ;) ).

Feel free to drop me @ line.
